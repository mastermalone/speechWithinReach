							<h1>Knowledge is Power</h1>
							<p>
								At Speech within Reach, we firmly believe that knowledge is power. 
								Over the years, many parents have come to us with questions 
								similar to those you may have. For that reason, we welcome you 
								to review our list of frequently asked questions for answers.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="faq-accordion" class="speech-accordion">
							<h3>Will my child’s speech and language catch up eventually with that of their peers?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>
									If you detect that your child is delayed or has 
									missed a developmental milestone, we recommend 
									an evaluation to determine what level they are at 
									and if speech therapy would help give them the 
									systems they need to catch up.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>Why is my older child talking a lot more than my younger child?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Often an older child will take on the role to help their younger sibling out and predict their needs; therefore, the younger child will not have to speak as often</p>
							</div>
							<h3>At what age should I expect my child's first full word?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Between 10 and 14 months.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>Should I teach my child sign language before they start talking?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>We recommend teaching basic sign language to an infant so that he or she can communicate their wants and needs, such as a desire for milk or food.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>I can't understand what my child is saying. What can I do?</h3>
							<div>
								<p> 
									Check the developmental milestones regarding 
									articulation. If your child's sounds are 
									delayed, I would recommend an evaluation to 
									determine if therapy is appropriate.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>What are some of the benefits of speech therapy for children with autism? </h3>
							<div>
								<p> The difficulties communicating that these children often face, frequently affect all aspects of their daily lives. Speech-Language therapy can improve their overall quality of life by increasing their comprehension, communication and social skills.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>What are some of the areas of speech and language that can be affected by an Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Many different areas of speech and language can be 
									affected but frequently the social aspects of 
									communication are the most noticeable.  For example, 
									your child may have difficulty providing eye contact, 
									maintaining topic, or initiating conversation. 
									Expressive language and comprehension are also 
									typically affected.  Expressive language difficulties 
									can be exhibited when attempting to communicate with 
									others. Comprehension difficulties are observed when 
									your child struggles to understand what others are 
									attempting to communicate to them, or when interpreting 
									the world around them.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>What are some steps that families of children with Autism can implement at home to help improve speech and language?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Therapy is individualized to each child's specific needs 
									because Autism is a spectrum disorder.  Below are some 
									strategies that have been successful in the home.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Keep directions short and to the point because long sequences can be confusing. If the child doesn't follow the direction after stating twice, show the child what to do such as "picking up the books" together.</li>
									<li>Often children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder have specific interests that become a "passion" or "fixation" (e.g., maps and trains).  These interests are great ways to motivate them to communicate and learn.  For example, put their favorite object out of reach and then require them to communicate to get the object.</li>
									<li>Children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder can be described as visual thinkers, so set up your home for visual learning. If your child is not speaking or has limited verbalizations, then pictures and/or sign language/gestures can be used to communicate.  For example, place pictures on various objects around your home (e.g., table, bed).  Walk around daily with your child saying the names of the items repeatedly and pointing to the pictures.  Initially it is common for your child to point to the pictures then use those words that are most reinforcing such as basic wants and needs frequently used throughout the day (e.g.,"bathroom", "drink", and "food").  They will soon progress to more specific words such as "juice" and "milk", and continue to increase their vocabulary.</li>
									<li>If your child is communicating with one or two words, you may increase their sentence length by adding words such as colors and numbers (e.g., red car).</li>
									<li>hildren with an Autism Spectrum Disorder may be more responsive to singing than speaking.</li>
									<li>To decrease your child's anxiety level, it may initially be appropriate for them to follow a routine. Give your child expectations of what will happen throughout the day by using a picture schedule. This will help prepare for transitioning from activity to activity. Giving a five-minute warning will also help the child to prepare for the change.</li>
									<li>Children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder may be hyper or hyposensitive. If they are hypersensitive, you will want to minimize distractions in the home including noise, lights and clutter.  If your child if hyposensitive, they may often seek hugs for sensory input.  It is ideal to have an Occupational Therapist to consult with to address your child's sensory needs.</li>
									<li>If your child is using lengthy and complex utterances, however frequently misses the nuances of communication such as humor then addressing idioms (e.g., break a leg), homophones (e.g., peace or piece), and sarcasm to increase their understanding of abstract thinking can be implemented.</li>
